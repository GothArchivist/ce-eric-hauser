          "text": "I sent [Madson?] a copy of secret orders from Colonel telling them to go to\nAltaussee. (shows medal of Major [Scheidler?]) Kaltenbrunner had building\nnumber 2 and [Bob?] kept and gave me this.\nPeople got used to saying “Heil Hitler” instead of hell and people often continued\nto say it. Funny in Schindler's List that no Heil Hitler's except Goeth being\nhanged.\n? When you returned to the states and told people, what was the response?\nBy then people were beginning to find out. I returned late November 1945. But I\ndon't think they could visualize. Mostly I discussed it with people involved like\n[Madson?] and [Haris?]. My family never pressed me about it. All of the sudden\npeople beginning to say don't forget. I thought for a while everyone would forget.\nSome people are not interested.\n(Nurses—shows pictures of nurses, supposedly sent by George, who wanted me\nto have you sent to nurse.)\n(In picture a supposed inmate looks too well fed to be an inmate)\nIn France I developed a tooth ache and went to dental officer of the military and\na Jewish dentist and with foot peddle drill he took care of it. When I told him CIC\n80th and asked me to bring him lugars so could use to fight for Palestine. I sent\nhome [Scheidler?]'s shotgun.\n\nI told my grandson to talk of Nazism against Americans, not Germans.\n(shows pictures: self as soldier, anti-NS civilian guards) They came to us and\ngave us information helpful in getting Kaltenbrunner.\nPerhaps someone in town didn't know about slaughter of people at the camp,\nbut I'm skeptical."
