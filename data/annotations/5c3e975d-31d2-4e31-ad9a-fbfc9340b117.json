It was annexed to the Habsburg Empire in 1772 until the First World War, then was part of the Second Polish Republic until the Second World War. During the Nazi occupation, an estimated 5000 Jews (800 families) were murdered. See P. Wrobel, “The Jews of Galicia under Austrian Polish Rule, 1869-1918,” in "

A few days before the Soviet takeover, the German military and SS-police started to force Jews into labor assignments, steal property and enlist Ukrainian nationalist collaborators in securing the conquered territory. When the Germans returned and pushed out the Soviets in July 1941, they organized a pogrom as an act of revenge for the political prisoners found murdered by the retreating NKVD in the local prison. Some 350 Jews were killed in the pogrom. During the Nazi occupation, the local police - a platoon of Austrians - was commanded by Gustav Wuepper (1893-1958). He organized the first mass shootings of Jews deemed unfit as laborers, about 700-800 Jewish women, children and the elderly, shot on Nov 29th in the nearby forests of Truskawiec and Tustanowice. Ghettoization followed as did Jewish deaths owing to the winter cold, lack of food and the spread of typhus.  Round ups and killings resumed in July 1942 culminating in the deportations of some 5000 Jews to the Janowska camp near Lwow and the Belzec killing center. Specialists were selected out and kept in two open ghettos that served as labor camps. Those like Hauser with the “R” armbands working for the armaments industry in the oil fields were allowed to remain, but some including their family members were deported to Belzec, and those pulled out of hiding places were shot on the spot by Wuepper’s men. Searches and executions continued during the winter of 1942-43, and were renewed in the Boryslaw ghetto liquidation in late May-June 1943. The population had been reduced to 400 who were mostly hiding in the nearby forests, or had joined the Polish communist partisans. The Red Army arrived August 7, 1944.  See the entry for Boryslaw/Boryslav in Dean, ed. "

During the war he was able to avoid military service and secure a commission as manager of the Carpathian Oil Company in Boryslaw. The company housed Hauser and other Jewish laborers and specialists, and their families, in designated camps and issued them the special armaments worker’s badge, “R.” Beitz witnessed the pogroms of July 1941 and subsequent German police raids of the camps including the massacre of children in the orphanage on August 7, 1942. Beitz was able to select hundreds of workers, thereby sparing them from deportations to Belzec. Beitz and his wife rescued Jews by hiding them, informing them of impending massacres, and issuing work permits. Beitz left Boryslaw in March 1944. The Gestapo learned of his forged permits, and he was needed in the army. After the war he became the head of the Krupp Steel conglomerate and led West Germany’s economic recovery. In 1973 he received the award of Righteous Among the Nations from Yad Vashem, with the support of hundreds of survivors but the objections of many others who believed that he was a war profiteer and not a resister. Beitz explained his motives as purely moral and not anti-fascist. Additional controversy stemmed from Beitz’s defense of Hildebrand in the 1966 Bremen trial. On 5 February 2006 Yad Vashem recognized Berthold’s wife Else Beitz as Righteous Among the Nations. https://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/stories/beitz.html"
